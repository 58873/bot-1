# GAwesomeBot

*Welcome to GAwesomeBot, the community revival of AwesomeBot! This repo will be mostly focused on bug fixes rather than any sort of new features (especially music, get out if you're searching for that).*
The official GAwesomeBot instance, [GAwesomeBot](https://bot.gilbertgobbels.xyz:8008), will always run the latest code from this repo.

## Contributing
Contributions are always appreciated; however, we use a special branching model to keep in mind when creating pull requests. For example, any PRs pointing at the `master` branch will be deleted or edited to point at the `development` branch instead. If you want to create a PR for a new feature that is currently being worked on, point it to the correct feature branch, most likely named something along the lines of `feature-music`, if the feature is music.

Want to learn more about our branching model? It's heavily inspired by [nvie's model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).
