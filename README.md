# GAwesomeBot

*Welcome to GAwesomeBot. The community revival of AwesomeBot! This repo will be mostly focused on bug fixes rather than any sort of new features (including music, get out if you're searching for that).*
The newest code in this repo will always be runned by [GAwesomeBot](http://ssl.gilbertgobbels.xyz:8008)
