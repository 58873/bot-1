## Contributing
Contributions are always appreciated; however, we use a special branching model to keep in mind when creating pull requests. For example, any PRs pointing at the `master` branch will be deleted or edited to point at the `development` branch instead. If you want to create a PR for a new feature that is currently being worked on, point it to the correct feature branch, most likely named something along the lines of `feature-music`, if the feature is music.

Want to learn more about our branching model? It's heavily inspired by [nvie's model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).
